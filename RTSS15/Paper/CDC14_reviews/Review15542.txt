Comments to the author
======================

The proposed algorithm has the advantages of taking the
state and control input constraints into account and
offering a trade-off between the computation time and the
estimation accuracy.  

The paper is clearly written, well organized. In order to
improve the paper, there are two questions listed in the
following could be addressed.

1) How do you find the modes (\delta, \epsilon) in
practice? The authors explain a little bit about the
realization of the modes in the case study section. It
would be nice if the authors can provide something more to
convince the reader about the values of the modes. 

-> We need a better computation model/ realistic example.

2) Is it possibile to jointly optimize the continuous
variables (x and u) and the discrete variables (the modes)
to obtain an optimal solution? Perhaps mixed-integer
programming would help. 

-> I'd say no, because the discrete variable is coupled with the continuous one in the dynamics equations. I was looking into the relaxation of the discrete variable and we came to the conclusion that the problem was intractable.

It seems that as the modes are fixed, the problem becomes
an ordinary robust MPC problem. Therefore, it might be very
important to say something more about how to select and
characterize the modes. 

-> The switching between modes is what differentiates it from an ordinary robust MPC problem. Although it doesn't take away from the fact that computation model has to be justified.
