\section{Case Study: Real-time feedback control of a hexrotor with contract based estimation and robust control}
\label{sec:experiments}

\subsection{Experimental setup}
To evaluate our methodology on a real platform, we applied it to a hexrotor tasked with repeatedly following a given circular trajectory. We use SVO (Section \ref{delayErrorCurve}) as estimator and RAMPC as the controller. The obtained execution time distributions for SVO are shown in Fig.\ref{fig:time_ecdf}. Details of the experimental setup are in the online technical report \cite{RTSS15TechRpt324}.
