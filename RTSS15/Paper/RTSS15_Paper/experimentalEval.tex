\subsection{Experimental Evaluation}

After profiling the performance of the perception and estimation algorithm and formulating the Robust MPC controller for the hex-rotor model (equation \ref{}), we experimentally evaluate the tracking performance and estimated energy consumption based on actual flights around a pre-defind trajectory. For comparision, we use a Model Predictive Controller (also coded in CVXGEN) with the same cost function and initial feasible sets as in our Robust MPC formulation. Comparision to such a controller would give a baseline to measure the benefits of our co-design method against the a similar control algorithm that does not leverage co-design and is unaware of the estimator algorithm that gives it a state estimate. Note, in our experimental evaluation, due to WHAT??? we did not use visual odometry for localization but simulate the behaviour of the visual odometry based estimation by adding a delay and norm bounded estimation error as profiled ($\forall i \mid (\delta_i,\epsilon_i) \in \Delta $) for the different Visual odometry modes to the VICON based measurements. 

For the evaluation, we fly in a predefined trajectory as shown in figure \ref{}, repeating the experiment 10 times to gather enough data to conclusively measure the performance of Robust MPC and MPC with fixed modes of ($\delta,\epsilon$). Note that since the controller was a sampled discrete-time controller working with simulated 20Hz camera updates, this realistically restricts us to using modes of estimator operation with delay ($\delta$) less than (1/20s), or one sampling period, i.e. modes corresponding to 50, 100, 150 and 200 maximum corners from the FAST detector (see figure \ref{}). These modes and their estimated power consumption is in table \ref{tbl:modes_exp}. Note, \#C represents maximum number of FAST corners requested, $\epsilon$ shows the worst case error bound on the state estimate, $\delta$ is the $90^{th}$ percentile execution time for that mode, and $E[P]$ represents the estimated power consumption in that mode as profiled offline.
