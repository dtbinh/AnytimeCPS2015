\section{Online Operation of Contract-Based Estimation and Control}
\label{controlProblem}
In this section we present the mathematical formulation of the online operation of the co-designed system presented in the previous section.
Specifically, we model the controller and physical system from Fig. ??, and demonstrate how the controller can, in real-time, use knowledge of the estimator's error-delay curve to decrease computation delay and power in an error-aware fashion.
This section is written in a tutorial fashion using a running example, with emphasis placed on the contract-based interaction between controller and estimator.
