\section{Anytime control}
\label{controlProblem}
In this section we present the mathematical formulation of the framework presented in the previous section, and demonstrate how to solve it.
Specifically, we model the controller and physical system from Fig. ??, and demonstrate how the controller can, in real-time, use knowledge of the estimator's error-delay curve to decrease computation delay and power in an error-aware fashion.
This section is written in a tutorial fashion using a running example, with emphasis placed on the contract-based interaction between controller and estimator.
