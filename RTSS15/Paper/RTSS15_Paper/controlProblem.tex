\section{Robust Control with Contract-Based Estimator}
\label{controlProblem}
In this section we present the mathematical formulation to model the controller and physical system from Fig. \ref{fig:codesignedCE}, and demonstrate how the controller can, in real-time, use knowledge of the estimator's error-delay curve to decrease computation delay and power in an error-aware fashion.
