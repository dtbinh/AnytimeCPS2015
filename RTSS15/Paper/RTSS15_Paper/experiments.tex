\section{Case Study: Real-time feedback control of a hexrotor with contract based estimation and robust control}
\label{sec:experiments}

\subsection{Experimental setup}
To evaluate our methodology on a real platform, we applied it to a hexrotor tasked with repeatedly following a given circular trajectory.
We use SVO (Section \ref{delayErrorCurve}) as estimator and RAMPC as the controller.
Details of the experimental setup, and of the obtained delay-error curve for SVO, are in the Appendix.
