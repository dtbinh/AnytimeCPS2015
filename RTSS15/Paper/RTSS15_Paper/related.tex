Approximate computing approaches \cite{loop-perf,rely,npu} seek time or energy
savings by performing a computation approximately instead of precisely. While
anytime algorithms and approximate computing share a high-level goal,
approximate computing approaches are run-to-completion and also lack a feedback
mechanism to permit computation and resources to be balanced dynamically.
