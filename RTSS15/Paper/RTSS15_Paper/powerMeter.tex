To measure the power consumption of our Odroid computing platform, we utilized
an Odroid Smart Power meter \cite{OdroidSmartPower}, which measures power
consumption at 10Hz to milliwatt precision. We measure the power consumption of
the entire Odroid board, including CPU and DRAM power consumption. To avoid the
physical challenges of fitting the power meter onto our hex-copter platform, we
measure the power consumption of the Odroid board on the ground, running the
same controller and vision workloads as it does during flight.

TODO: elaborate more about how we simulate realistic flight workloads?
