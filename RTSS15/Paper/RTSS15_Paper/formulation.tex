\subsection{Problem formulation}
\label{formulation}

Recapitulate main elements of setup: controller chooses which $(\delta,\epsilon)$ to operate at next.

System model: linear ODE. 
This models a wide range of systems, including hexarotor at a certain level of approximation.
E.g. the hexarotor's state vector is $[x,y,z,\dot{x},\dot{y},\dot{z}]$,
its inputs are desired pitch, roll and thrust.
The specific hexarotor equations are in [??].
The system is usually constrained to be in some safe set $S$, e.g. $\{Ax \leq b\}$.

For flight, the hexarotor needs to localize itself, i.e. it needs to produce an \emph{estimate} of its current state $x$.
It does so by taking a video through a downward facing camera, detecting and tracking features across frames, and deducing its own position relative to these features.
This produces a state estimate $\hat{x}$, which equals the true state $x + $ random error.
This estimate is fed to the controller which produces a control action $u$ based on it, constrained to be in a set, e.g. $\{l_b \leq u \leq u_b\}$.
This control is input to the linear system dynamics.

Sensing, estimation and actuation happen at discrete time instants, which produces de facto discretized dynamics.
