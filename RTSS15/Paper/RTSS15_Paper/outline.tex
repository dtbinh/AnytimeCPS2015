\begin{enumerate}
	\item Introduction
	
	\item Motivating example: 
	\subitem hexrotor that is unstable/poor-performing with MPC because of actuation delay
	\subitem Operating at lowest delay (= worst performance) is not good either 
	\subitem How can we reduce the actuation delay while keeping a handle on estimation error? 
	Anytime control formulation explicity accounts for delay/error and optimizes over it.
	\subitem A delay-error trade-off curve + control formulation that accounts for it
	
	\item Control problem and solution
	\subitem MPC control formulation 
	\subitem Solution
	
	\item Delay-error curve 
	\subitem Perception and estimation toolchain. Each component has knobs that make it anytime.
	\subitem Perception+estimation is a task with varying utility and execution time. The controller schedules the task with the best utility/execution time.
	\subitem this is also a utility/computation power trade-off.
	\subitem Example: corner detection for visual odometry
	\subitem Example: Yash's OpenCV toolchain: flowgraph and potentially curves.
	
	\item Experiment
	\subitem Show the curve on the quadrotor with ordroid (or maybe move to previous section)
	\subitem Computation power
	\subitem Experimental setup
	\subitem Take system from intro and show results with RAMPC: better performance/ stable.
	\subitem Degradation experiment: as we decrease control frequency and increase flying speed, performance degrades. How does degradation compare between the two.
