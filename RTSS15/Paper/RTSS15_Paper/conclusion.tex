\label{conclusion}

In this paper we presented a contract-based methodology for co-design of estimation and control for autonomous systems. 
The basic idea is that the control algorithm requests a time and estimation error $\de$ contract that the perception-and-estimation algorithm realizes. The control algorithm we designed aims to set time varying contracts to maximise a performance function while guaranteeing feasibility constraints and stability under the time varying execution time and estimation error from the estimator. We also illustrate how the contract based perception-and-estimation algorithm is designed offline and used at run-time to best meet the $\de$ contracts set for it. Through a case study on a flying hex-rotor, we showed the applicability of our scheme to real-time closed loop system. The experimental results show the good performance of our scheme and how it outperforms regular Model Predictive Control which does not leverage co-design. A key result showed how our closed loop solution is more energy efficient than MPC while achieving better tracking performance. A focus of ongoing research is to overcome the necessity of the contracts always being met by the estimator in order of us to have strong mathematical guarantees for the control performance. Another focus is on an automated tool chain to profile perception algorithms commonly used in autonomous systems.
