\section{Future work}

Given the profiling information, on-going work is focussed on developing a supervisory algorithm that decides at run-time what mode the perception algorithm operates on based on the closed loop performance of the system. Also being developed are control algorithms that can work with the trade-off offered by switching of operating modes of the perception algorithm while guaranteeing safe operation of the closed loop systems (e.g. respecting constraints on position and velocity). A more experimental approach also being looked at is switching between multiple PID controllers (each tuned for one mode of the estimation algorithm) based on the error signal from the vanishing point algorithm, which is the only feedback in the simple corridor navigation system which was considered in this work.
