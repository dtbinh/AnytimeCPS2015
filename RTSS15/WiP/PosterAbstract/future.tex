\section{Future work}

Given the profiling information, on-going work is focused on developing a supervisory algorithm that decides at run-time what mode the perception algorithm should operate in based on the closed loop performance of the system. 
We are also developing a model predictive controller that can leverage the time/power/quality trade-off while guaranteeing safe operation of the closed loop system (e.g., respecting constraints on position and velocity). A more experimental approach also being looked at is switching between multiple PID controllers (each tuned to one mode of the estimation algorithm) based on the error signal from the vanishing point algorithm, which is the only feedback in the simple corridor navigation system which was considered in this work.
