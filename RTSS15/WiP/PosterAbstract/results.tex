\subsection{Results}

Figures \ref{fig:dfsa} and \ref{fig:sfda} show the profiling results for the update rate of the Vanishing Point algorithm for different CPU-GPU allocations of the 3 tasks and different frequencies of the CPU and the GPU. 
Note, the CPU can be clocked upto 2.32 GHz (on all 4 cores), while the GPU can be clocked upto 0.852 GHz. 
We select 6 operating frequencies evenly spaced from the minimum and maximum Jetson CPU and GPU frequencies for both the CPU and the GPU. 
In these figures, the 3 letter combinations encode the CPU-GPU allocation .
For example, C G C means that the Blur was run on the CPU, Canny on the GPU and the Hough transform on the CPU.

Figures \ref{fig:dfsa_pow} and \ref{fig:sfda_pow} show the profiling of average power consumed during the computations for the vanishing point over all frames in the video used for the profiling.
