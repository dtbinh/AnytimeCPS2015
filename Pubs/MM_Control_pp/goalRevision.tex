\section{The Goal Revision framework}

For autonomous systems with higher level specifications, situations may arise when satisfying all of the high level specifications is not possible. An example would be,
...
In such scenarios, it is preferable to satisfy the more important specifications while possibly violating ones with lesser importance. The automata of Fig.\ref{} (\ypcomment{The automata you drew to show me the preference order of specs})  shows the preference of satisfaction of subformulae that make up the overall specification of the form:
\begin{equation}
\formula = \always (\Phi_1 \land \Phi_2 \land \Phi_3)
\end{equation}







With specifications written in MTL, a bottom-up view of the goal revision problem leads us to three important sub-problems that need to be solved:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Control for satisfaction of one MTL specification}: Before we can move on to the complete goal revision problem, the question arises on how can we control a system to satisfy a given MTL specification. Existing approaches involve MILP formulations of MTL specifications \cite{Raman14_MPCSTL}, but do not scale well as formulae become complex. On going work on maximizing a smooth approximation of MTL robustness \cite{PantAM17_SmoothOpTechRpt} has led to promising results with regards to overall performance, run-times and scalability of the method beyond MILP based approaches. The method applies to time bounded MTL formulae and like existing approaches, requires solving for a control horizon that is as long as the formula length itself, which is not ideal for real-time implementations. There is also a need to extend the methods to incorporate uncertainties in the knowledge of the state of the system and the environment.

\item \textit{Receding Horizon control for a given MTL specification}: For a more tractable control algorithm, it is important to be able to solve a control problem with a look-ahead horizon smaller than the MTL formula's time horizon. No current approach does this while guaranteeing the important \textit{recursive feasibility} like property which is common in MPC. On going work focuses on using the concept to \textit{feasibility envelopes}\cite{Belta_FE_CDC16} for MTL formulae to enforce a \textit{terminal} constraint on the receding-horizon control problem to guarantee weaker form of recursive feasibility.
