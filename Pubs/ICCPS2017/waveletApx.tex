\subsection{Wavelet approximations}
\label{sec:waveletApx}

Wavelets can be viewed as a generalization of the kernel $g_\varepsilon$ of the previous section to a whole family of kernels, obtained by translations and dilations of one function called the `mother wavelet' $\psi$: $\psi_{k,j}(x) = \sqrt{2^{-j}}\psi(2^{-j}(x-k))$  \cite{MallatBook}.
They are used extensively in signal processing, as they have very good approximation properties, including fast convergence and multi-scale analysis.
See \cite{MallatBook}.
In the experiments in the rest of this paper, we used the Meyer wavelets.
