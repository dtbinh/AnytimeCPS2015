	abstract="Safety verification of hybrid systems is undecidable, except for very special cases. In this paper, we circumvent undecidability by providing a verification algorithm that provably terminates for all robust problem instances, but need not necessarily terminate for non-robust problem instances. A problem instance x is robust iff the given property holds not only for x itself, but also when x is perturbed a little bit. Since, in practice, well-designed hybrid systems are usually robust, this implies that the algorithm terminates for the cases occurring in practice. In contrast to earlier work, our result holds for a very general class of hybrid systems, and it uses a continuous time model.",

	pages="157--185",
	abstract="In this paper we consider a fragment of the first-order theory of the real numbers that includes systems of n equations in n variables, and for which all functions are computable in the sense that it is possible to compute arbitrarily close interval approximations. Even though this fragment is undecidable, we prove that---under the additional assumption of bounded domains---there is a (possibly non-terminating) algorithm for checking satisfiability such that (1) whenever it terminates, it computes a correct answer, and (2) it always terminates when the input is robust. A formula is robust, if its satisfiability does not change under small continuous perturbations. We also prove that it is not possible to generalize this result to the full first-order language---removing the restriction on the number of equations versus number of variables. As a basic tool for our algorithm we use the notion of degree from the field of topology.",
