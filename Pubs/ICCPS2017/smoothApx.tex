%???Indeed, we may view boolean semantics, robust semantics, and smooth robust semantics as lying on one spectrum: 
%in boolean semantics, we use discontinuous (hard) indicator functions for the atomic sets $A = \Oc(p)$: $d^\Be_A(x) = 0$ if $x \in A$, and equals 1 otherwise.
%In robust semantics, this is replaced by a continuous indicator function: $d_A^C(x)$ equals the distance between point $x$ and the set $A$, and thus decreases continuously from positive values (outside the set) to 0 (inside it).
%In the smooth robust semantics we introduce here, we use a smooth indicator function: $d_A^S(x)$ is a differentiable approximation to $d_A^C$, and thus decreases smoothly from positive values to 0.
