We implemented the above smooth approximation to the semantics of MTL, and tested them empirically on a number of examples.

In order to study the quality of approximation empirically, we evaluated robustness and its approximation for multiple formulae for 1000 random trajectories (of varying lengths) generated for a system with 2-states and point mass dynamics with input and state saturation. We also evaluate a single formula, for a 3-state point mass system, to observe the approximation errors in a higher dimension. Here, in all formulae, $P1$ is defined as $x \in [-1,1]^2$, and $P2$ as $x\in [2,2.5]^2$ (and similarly in $\mathbb{R}^3$).

Fig. \ref{fig:sample result} shows the Root Mean Square (RMSE) and variance of approximation errors $\robf-\srobf$ to give an idea of the magnitude of the approximation errors for multiple formulae. 
It is expected, and seen to some extent in Fig. \ref{fig:sample result}, that (for a constant number of wavelet coefficients) approximation error will grow as trajectory length grows. This is due to the smooth max and min functions, as seen in \eqref{eq:smooth max error}.

Fig. \ref{fig:relative error} shows the relative approximation errors, $(\robf-\srobf)/|\robf|$, for the formulae under consideration. It is seen that the relative average approximation is less than $10\%$ for all cases. 

For some data points in Fig. \ref{fig:relative error}, the variance of relative error is high, suggesting that the approximation errors vary \todo[inline]{bigly}. This is not true, as it is worth noting in Fig. \ref{fig:sample result} that the variance of the actual approximation is very small. The high relative approximation errors are due to trajectories which have a true robustness of near zero, leading to a spike in the relative approximation error, $(\robf-\srobf)/|\robf|$, even for small values of the true approximation error, $\robf-\srobf$.

Also while Fig.\ref{fig:sample result} suggests that the approximation error grows as dimension of the state grows from $2$ to $3$, Fig. \ref{fig:relative error} shows that the relative approximation error is still small. 
%As explained in the previous section, better approximation can be achieved by increasing the number of wavelet coefficients as dimension, and trajectory length, grow.
