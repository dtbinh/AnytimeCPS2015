\section{Approximation error, verification and control}
\label{sec:examples}
We implemented the above smooth approximation to the semantics of MTL, and tested it empirically on a number of examples.

We evaluated the robustness $\robf$ and its approximation $\srobf$ for five formulae, with $hrz(\formula_i) = N$. $P_1$ and $P_2$ are atomic propositions for state being in two polyhedrons $P_1$ and $P_2$ respectively. 
%Each formula is of the form $\formula_i = \always_{[0:N-1]} \psi$, where $N$ is the length of the trajectory.
%Thus $hrz(\formula_i)  = N$.
Each formula's robustness is evaluated on 1000 randomly-generated trajectories of varying lengths $N$, so we can  examine the error's variation with the horizon.
The trajectories were produced by either a 2-dimensional point-mass system \eqref{eq:PointMass} or a 3-dimensional point-mass system, with input and state saturation.
%All formulas use the atomic propositions $P_1 \defeq x \in [-1,1]^n$ and $P_2 \defeq x\in [2,2.5]^n$, where $n = 2,3$ is the dimension of the system.
%The state-space is $[-5,5]^n$ and the input set is $\inpSet = [-0.3,0.3]^n$. 

Fig. \ref{fig:sample result} shows the Root Mean Square (RMSE) of the approximation, $\sqrt{(1/1000)\sum_{\sstraj}(\robf(\sstraj)-\srobf(\sstraj))^2}$
, and variance bars around it.
As suggested by Remark \ref{rem:upper bound}, the approximation error generally increases with the horizon (for a constant number of wavelet coefficients).
This is due to the smooth max and min functions, as seen in \eqref{eq:smooth max error}.

Fig. \ref{fig:relative error} shows the relative approximation errors, $(\robf-\srobf)/|\robf|$, for the formulae under consideration. 
It is seen that the average relative approximation error is less than $10\%$ for all cases. 
For some data points in Fig. \ref{fig:relative error}, the variance of relative error is high, the error remains small in absolute terms as seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:sample result}.

%In general, the high relative approximation errors are due to trajectories which have a true robustness of near zero; 
%these lead to a spike in the relative approximation error, $(\robf-\srobf)/|\robf|$, even for small values of the absolute error $|\robf-\srobf|$.

%suggesting that the approximation errors vary wildly. This is not the case, as it is worth noting in Fig. \ref{fig:sample result} that the variance of the actual approximation is very small. 

%\todo[inline]{not sure what the point is in this paragraph...previous figure gives (roughly) average error. this gives relative error. one does not cancel out the other. the relative error does vary a lot in some case, as evidenced here. one can only say that even though relative error can vary a lot inn some case, the absolute }

Note that while the RMSE  increased with the system dimension($4^{th}$ formula in Fig.~\ref{fig:sample result}), the relative error remained very small ($4^{th}$ formula in Fig.~\ref{fig:relative error}), i.e. the increase in error is explained by an increase in the robustness's value. 
%As explained in the previous section, better approximation can be achieved by increasing the number of wavelet coefficients as dimension, and trajectory length, grow.
