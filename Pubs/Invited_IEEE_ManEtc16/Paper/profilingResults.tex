Figure \ref{fig:sfda} shows the profiling results for the throughput of 
VP at different CPU-GPU allocations of the 3 tasks and different frequencies of the CPU and the GPU. 
Note, the CPU can be clocked upto 2.32 GHz (on all 4 cores), while the GPU can be clocked upto 0.852 GHz. 
We select 6 operating frequencies evenly spaced between the minimum and maximum CPU and GPU frequencies.

Figure \ref{fig:sfda_pow} shows the profiling of average power consumed by VP over all frames in the video for the same combinations of the knobs.
