For the Vanishing Point (VP) algorithm, the first stage of our method is profiling the timing and power consumption of the computation.
Namely, we vary the schedule and frequency knobs described in Section \ref{sec:knobs}.
For each value of the knobs, we run VP on a video sequence previously acquired by the robot while navigating a corridor. 
We wrote a custom C-code library to log power measurements from a Tektronix PWS4205 Programmable DC power supply at 100Hz. 
For this we communicate with the power supply over USB using the USB Test and Measurement Class (USB-TMC) communication protocol. 
 
Since for an algorithm like VP there is no well-defined notion of output quality, we use the update rate as a performance measure, since faster updates mean that the car controller has less delay, resulting in better control performance.
