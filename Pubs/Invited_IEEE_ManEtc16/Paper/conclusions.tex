\section{Conclusions}

In this paper, we introduce a two stage approach for hardware level optimization in order to trade-off throughput and power consumption of a perception algorithm. We use the vanishing point algorithm based corridor navigation as a running case study throughout the paper and simulate the closed loop performance based on the experimentally profiled vanishing point performance from a $1/10^{th}$ scale autonomous car. Through the simulations, we show that our run-time optimization for the trade-off results in negligible degradation of control performance ($\leq1\%$) while significantly reducing computation energy (around $20\%$). In this work, one drawback is that the control algorithm itself is unaware of the trade-offs, unlike our work in $\cite{RTSS15}$. Future work, in addition to developing a control algorithm that is aware of the trade-offs, will also focus on experimentally verifying the performance our method by closing the loop on the $1/10^{th}$ scale autonomous car and moving beyond simulations.
