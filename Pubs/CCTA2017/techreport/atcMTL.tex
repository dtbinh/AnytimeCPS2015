{\sf Example1, continued}.
\textit{The ATC rules can be formalized in Metric Temporal Logic (MTL). Rule \ref{rule:floor ceiling} can be formalized as follows ($\always$ means `Always', $q$ is an aircraft and $q_z$ is its altitude).}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:rule1mtl}
\always( q \in Zone1 \implies q_z \leq \text{Ceiling1} \land q_z \geq \text{Floor1})
\end{equation}
Rule \ref{rule:holding} can be formalized as follows.
\begin{flalign}
\label{eq:rule3mtl}
\always(Busy \implies\eventually_{[t_1,t_2]} (&q \in \text{Holding-6} \, \lor \,q \in \text{Holding-7}) 
\nonumber \\
&\until_{[0,\text{MaxHolding}]} \neg Busy)
\end{flalign}

\textit{This says that Always ($\always$), if airport is Busy, then Eventually $(\eventually)$, sometime between times $t_1$ and $t_2$, the plane goes into a holding area.
It stays there $\until$ntil the airport is not ($\neg$) busy, or the timer expires at time MaxHolding.} 

\textit{By maximizing the robusness of these MTL specifications, the ATC can automatically find landing patterns that leave room for maneuvering in case of emergencies.}
\textit{Any unforeseen disturbance smaller than a known bounded size will not violate the rules, and will not lead to an unsafe situation.}
