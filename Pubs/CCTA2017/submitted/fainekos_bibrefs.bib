		abstract = {Sequential quadratic programming (SQP) methods are a popular class of methods for nonlinearly constrained optimization. They are particularly effective for solving a sequence of related problems, such as those arising in mixed-integer nonlinear programming and the optimization of functions subject to differential equation constraints. Recently, there has been considerable interest in the formulation of stabilized SQP methods, which are specifically designed to handle degenerate optimization problems. Existing stabilized SQP methods are essentially local in the sense that both the formulation and analysis focus on the properties of the methods in a neighborhood of a solution. A new SQP method is proposed that has favorable global convergence properties yet, under suitable assumptions, is equivalent to a variant of the conventional stabilized SQP method in the neighborhood of a solution. The method combines a primal-dual generalized augmented Lagrangian function with a flexible line search to obtain a sequence of improving estimates of the solution. The method incorporates a convexification algorithm that allows the use of exact second derivatives to define a convex quadratic programming (QP) subproblem without requiring that the Hessian of the Lagrangian be positive definite in the neighborhood of a solution. This gives the potential for fast convergence in the neighborhood of a solution. Additional benefits of the method are that each QP subproblem is regularized and the QP subproblem always has a known feasible point. Numerical experiments are presented for a subset of the problems from the \textttCUTEr test collection.

They define monotonous formulas (whose robustness is monotonous w.r.t. one or more params), and develop a binary search for finding the tightest parameter values such that the formula is satisfied. Monotonicity can be verified via an SMT solver. This is the paper that introduces NM as a falsification algorithm.},

	abstract = "Hybrid automata model systems with both digital and analog components, such as embedded control programs. Many verification tasks for such programs can be expressed as reachability problems for hybrid automata. By improving on previous decidability and undecidability results, we identify a boundary between decidability and undecidability for the reachability problem of hybrid automata. On the positive side, we give an (optimal) PSPACE reachability algorithm for the case of initialized rectangular automata, where all analog variables follow independent trajectories within piecewise-linear envelopes and are reinitialized whenever the envelope changes. Our algorithm is based on the construction of a timed automaton that contains all reachability information about a given initialized rectangular automaton. The translation has practical significance for verification, because it guarantees the termination of symbolic procedures for the reachability analysis of initialized rectangular automata. The translation also preserves theω-languages of initialized rectangular automata with bounded nondeterminism. On the negative side, we show that several slight generalizations of initialized rectangular automata lead to an undecidable reachability problem. In particular, we prove that the reachability problem is undecidable for timed automata augmented with a single stopwatch."

We show that the emptiness problem for robust timed automata is still decidable, by modifying the region construction for timed automata. We then show that, like timed automata, robust timed automata cannot be determinized. This result is somewhat unexpected, given that in temporal logic, the removal of realtime equality constraints is known to lead to a decidable theory that is closed under all boolean operations.},
	description = {For a given timed automaon A, first define a trajectory s, then a metric on the trajectory language L(A), the corresponding topology, then the tube language [L(A)] which is the set of open tubes O such that L(A) is dense in O. Prove some properties for it. Then generalize slightly to hybrid (not just timed) automata in Section 6, where the distance metric is the Haussdorf distance between the two trajectories (viewed as sets \{(t,x(t))\}). Kosentini and Caspi show in their FORMATS2004 paper on voting that their Skorokhod topology is finer than the tube topology.},

  abstract = {Recently, Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) has been introduced as a tool
	for formal specification of dynamical control systems. Employing
	this formal approach, control systems can be designed to provably
	accomplish a large class of complex tasks specified via LTL. For
	this purpose, many authors have employed language generator Buchi
	automata with finite abstractions of dynamical systems. In this paper,
	we take a mathematical programming-based approach to design optimal
	control laws that satisfy a LTL formula considering a broad class
	of discrete-time dynamical systems including hybrid piecewise linear
	systems. We also present similar tools for LTL model checking of
	such systems. The algorithms presented in this paper differ from
	the aforementioned existing approaches by employing mathematical
	programming instead of the language generator automata leading to
	a new tool for LTL model checking and satisfiability solver.},

	From formulae in this logic we create automatically property monitors
