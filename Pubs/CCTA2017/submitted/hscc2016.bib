	abstract = "This paper is driven by a general motto: bisimulate a hybrid system by a finite symbolic dynamical system. In the case of o-minimal hybrid systems, the continuous and discrete components can be decoupled, and hence, the problem reduces in building a finite symbolic dynamical system for the continuous dynamics of each location. We show that this can be done for a quite general class of hybrid systems defined on o-minimal structures. In particular, we recover the main result of a paper by G. Lafferriere, G.J. Pappas, and S. Sastry, on o-minimal hybrid systems. We also provide an analysis and extension of results on decidability and complexity of problems and constructions related to o-minimal hybrid systems. "

	abstract = "We show that quantifier elimination over real closed fields can require doubly exponential space (and hence time). This is done by explicitly constructing a sequence of expressions whose length is linear in the number of quantifiers, but whose quantifier-free expression has length doubly exponential in the number of quantifiers. The results can be applied to cylindrical algebraic decomposition, showing that this can be doubly exponential. The double exponents of our lower bounds are about one fifth of the double exponents of the best-known upper bounds. "

	abstract = "We develop a model-based framework which supports approximate quantitative verification of implantable cardiac pacemaker models over hybrid heart models. The framework is based on hybrid input–output automata and can be instantiated with user-specified pacemaker and heart models. For the specifications, we identify two property patterns which are tailored to the verification of pacemakers: “can the pacemaker maintain a normal heart behaviour?” and “what is the energy level of the battery after t time units?”. We implement the framework in Simulink based on the discrete-time simulation semantics and endow it with a range of basic and advanced quantitative property checks. The advanced property checks include the correction of pacemaker mediated Tachycardia and how the noise on sensor leads influences the pacing level. We demonstrate the usefulness of the framework for safety assurance of pacemaker software by instantiating it with two hybrid heart models and verifying a number of correctness properties with encouraging experimental results.

Within this framework, we view an excitable tissue as a composition of two main kinds of component: a diffusion medium and a collection of cells, both modeled as an HIOA. This approach yields a notion of decomposition that allows us to describe a tissue as the parallel composition of several interacting tissues, a property that could be exploited to parallelize, and hence improve, the efficiency of the simulation process. We also demonstrate the feasibility of our HIOA-based framework to capture and mimic different kinds of wave-propagation behavior in 2D isotropic cardiac tissue, including normal wave propagation along the tissue; the creation of spiral waves; the break-up of spiral waves into more complex patterns such as fibrillation; and the recovery of the tissue to the rest via electrical defibrillation.
