\section{Case studies}
\label{sec:case study}

This section focuses on evaluating the efficiency of Smooth Operator (SOP) by testing it on two systems and comparing to existing approaches.

\begin{itemize}
	\vspace{-1pt}
	\item SOP in (B)oolean and (R)obust modes.
	\vspace{-1pt}
	\item BluSTL in modes (B) and (R).
	\item R-SQP, which uses SQP to optimize the \textit{exact} non-smoothed robustness $\robf$.
	\vspace{-1pt}
	\item SA, which uses Simulated Annealing to optimize $\robf$.%the true robustness
	\vspace{-1pt}
\end{itemize}

For both case studies, the wavelet approximation to the distance function is computed off-line. 
The control problem \eqref{eq:general_ctrl} is solved as an open-loop, single-shot, finite-horizon constrained optimization.
This is then used in a shrinking horizon scheme in Sec~\ref{sec:online}.

The code to reproduce these results can be found at \protect\url{https://github.com/yashpant/SmoothOperator0}. Future versions of the code will focus on re-usability of the code. %and making it handle any system.
%In general, for a real online implementation, the problem can be solved in a receding horizon manner or in a manner where the state and actions of the past are stored an added as constraints at each time step while the look-ahead horizon of the optimization shrinks (similar to \cite{Raman14_MPCSTL}). The problem of which method is suitable for what kinds of specifications is left for future work.
%\todo[inline]{too soon, the control problem hasn't been formulated yet. first forumlate it (or, better, refer to section 4.2), \textit{solve it}, then critique it. Discussion of related work like Vasu's should be after you present what you did, not before}
%\todo[inline]{introduce two numerical examples. Finite horizon control in a single shot, can be applied in a receding/shrinking horizon approach wherever applicable.}
