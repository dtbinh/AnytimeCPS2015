%{\sf Example 1: Air Traffic Control}.
Air-Traffic Control (ATC) coordinates landing arrivals at an airport. 
ATCs have very complex rules to ensure that all airplanes, of different sizes and speeds, approach the airport and land safely, \textit{with sufficient margin to other airplanes} to accommodate emergencies.
Sample rules for the Chicago O'hare airport include 
(A) When an aircraft enters any of 3 designated zones, it must stay between that zone's altitude floor and ceiling, and 
(B)  If the airspace is too busy, an aircraft must remain in either holding zones $6$ or $7$, until some maximum amount of time expires.
