\section{Case studies}
\label{sec:case study}

To evaluate our approach, we solve a robustness maximization problem for control of two systems, using four methods (all of which are implemented in MATLAB)

\begin{itemize}
	\vspace{-5pt}
	\item SR-SQP, which uses SQP to optimize the smooth approximation to robustness, $\srobf$. We run this for both $boolean$ and $robust$ modes of operation as defined in the previous section.
	\vspace{-5pt}
	\item BluSTL. Also run for both $boolean$ and $robust$ modes of operation.
	\item R-SQP, which uses SQP to optimize the \textit{true} robustness, $\robf$.
	\vspace{-5pt}
	\item SA, which uses Simulated Annealing to optimize $\robf$.%the true robustness

\end{itemize}

%A) Temperature control of a 4-state, single-zone model of a room, with an occupancy dependent comfort specification (similar to \cite{Raman14_MPCSTL}) and B) An Autonomous Centralized Air Traffic Control system for control of two quad-rotors in a constrained airspace with an obstacle, the specification in which corresponds to safely landing the two quad-rotors while following the rules of the airspace. We compare out approach, which consists of gradient descent on the smooth robustness of the specification (via SQP) to A) Simulated Annealing (\cite{}) for robustness maximization and B) Gradient descent on the robustness function (via SQP). 
%\todo[inline]{rather than this intro, just start giving each case study subsection. so lose above paragraph, maybe just one sentence that says "we evaluated the control performance using smooth robustness on a alnging bla and a building bla." Also don't use A and B twice, every time for different things. }

%All methods are implemented in MATLAB, and 
%solving the control problem is preceded by an offline phase which consists of finding the wavelet parameters for the signed distance function approximation for all atomic propositions involving polyhedrons. 
%\todo[inline]{sentence is long and awkward and mixes 2 very different pieces of information. can simply say "we compute the wavelet approimation of the distance function to the sets $\Oc(p)$ off-line"}

For both examples considered here, first, we compute the wavelet approximation of the distance function to the sets $\Oc(p)$ off-line. Next, we solve the control problem \eqref{eq:general_ctrl} as a single shot, finite horizon constrained optimization. 
%In general, for a real online implementation, the problem can be solved in a receding horizon manner or in a manner where the state and actions of the past are stored an added as constraints at each time step while the look-ahead horizon of the optimization shrinks (similar to \cite{Raman14_MPCSTL}). The problem of which method is suitable for what kinds of specifications is left for future work.
%\todo[inline]{too soon, the control problem hasn't been formulated yet. first forumlate it (or, better, refer to section 4.2), \textit{solve it}, then critique it. Discussion of related work like Vasu's should be after you present what you did, not before}
%\todo[inline]{introduce two numerical examples. Finite horizon control in a single shot, can be applied in a receding/shrinking horizon approach wherever applicable.}

%\todo[inline]{skipping fr now}
With two case studies on dynamic systems, we show the applicability and consistently good performance of our method, SR-SQP, which outperforms both SA and R-SQP. For every instance we covered, SR-SQP finds trajectories that satisfy the specification, while the other two methods do not always do so.

%Also, while in the first case study, R-SQP, in the second case study, simulated annealing cannot find trajectories that satisfy the specification from two of the three initial trajectories (used as initial solutions for optimization). Our method on the other hand, successfully finds a trajectory that satisfies the specification, while resulting in the best robustness value achieved across all examples considered. 

While we solve the control problem in a single-shot, finite horizon manner, in general, for a real-time implementation, the problem can be solved in a receding horizon manner (similar to \cite{PantAMNDM15_Anytime}, \cite{Jain2016}). Or, it can be solved in a manner where the state and actions of the past are stored an added as constraints at each time step while the look-ahead horizon of the optimization shrinks (similar to \cite{Raman14_MPCSTL}). This will be explored further in future work. We have shown previously \cite{PantAMNDM15_Anytime} that control of an actual quad-rotor with the dynamics in \eqref{eq:quad_dyn} is possible on a low computation power platform. The control algorithm there involved solving multiple quadratic programs at even higher sampling rates ($20Hz$), in a receding horizon manner. Future work will include a C implementation of SR-SQP, which will allow us to experiment on real platforms, like the aforementioned quad-rotors.
%Since all implementations were done in MATLAB, the focus was not real-time applicability of the proposed method. For the first case study, where the dynamics are slow, our method should still be applicable ($\sim 20s$) of execution time (compared to $\sim 5 \text{ mins}$ for SA). For the second case study a MATLAB implementation is infeasible due to the very fast dynamics and sampling times involved. We have shown previously in \cite{PantAMNDM15_Anytime} that control of a real quad-rotor with the dynamics in \eqref{eq:quad_dyn} is possible on a low computation power platform while solving multiple quadratic programs at even higher sampling rates ($20Hz$). With this in mind, we expect a C/C++ implementation of SQP (and the smooth robustness function) should allow us to implement our method on such a system. Ongoing work focuses on a general interpreter for formulae to generate corresponding smooth robustness functions, as well as their derivatives.
