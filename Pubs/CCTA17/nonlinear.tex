\subsection{A Non-linear example}
Since SQP can handle non-linear (twice differentiable) constraints, our method can inherently also deal with non-linear dynamics whereas the MILP based methods have to linearize dynamics to solve the system. The following example shows SR-SQP applied in a one-shot manner to a unicycle model discretized at 10Hz.
