\subsubsection{A Non-linear example: Unicycle}
\label{sec:nl_unicycle}
Since SQP can handle non-linear (twice differentiable) constraints, our method can inherently also deal with non-linear dynamics whereas the MILP based methods have to linearize dynamics to solve the system. The following example shows SOP applied in a one-shot manner to the unicycle dynamics ($\dot{x}_t=v_t \cos (\theta_t)\, ,\dot{y}_t=v_t \sin (\theta_t)\, ,\dot{\theta}_t= u_t$) discretized at 10Hz.

%\begin{subequations}
%\label{eq:unicycle}
%\begin{align}
%\dot{x}_t &=v_t \cos (\theta_t) \nonumber \\ 
%\dot{y}_t &=v_t \sin (\theta_t) \nonumber \\
%\dot{\theta}_t &= u_t
%\end{align}
%\end{subequations}

For the specification of Ex. \ref{ex:toyproblem}, the resulting trajectory of length 20 steps with SOP in $\textit{robust}$ mode is shown in fig.\ref{fig:toy control}, starting from an initial state of $[-2,-2,0]$. The resulting robustness is $0.248$, which is close to the value of the global optima of $0.25$. Note how the trajectory terminates close to the middle of the terminal set (where the global maxima is achieved as discussed previously), similar to the SOP (R) trajectory for the illustrative example. This shows that SOP can indeed handle non-linear dynamics without the need for explicit linearization as is done in MILP based methods.
