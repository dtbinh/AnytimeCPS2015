\section{Approximation error and control}
\label{sec:examples}
We implemented the smooth approximation to the semantics of MTL, and tested it empirically on several examples.

We evaluated the robustness $\robf$ and its approximation $\srobf$ for five formulae, with $hrz(\formula_i) = N$. $P_1$ and $P_2$ are atomic propositions for state being in two different polyhedra.
%Each formula is of the form $\formula_i = \always_{[0:N-1]} \psi$, where $N$ is the length of the trajectory.
%Thus $hrz(\formula_i)  = N$.
Each formula's robustness is evaluated on 1000 randomly-generated trajectories of varying lengths $N$, so we can  examine the error's variation with the horizon.
The trajectories were produced by a 2-or-3 dimensional system, \eqref{eq:PointMass} with input and state saturation.
%All formulas use the atomic propositions $P_1 \defeq x \in [-1,1]^n$ and $P_2 \defeq x\in [2,2.5]^n$, where $n = 2,3$ is the dimension of the system.
%The state-space is $[-5,5]^n$ and the input set is $\inpSet = [-0.3,0.3]^n$. 

Fig. \ref{fig:sample result} shows the Root Mean Square (RMSE) of the approximation, $\sqrt{(1/1000)\sum_{\sstraj}(\robf(\sstraj)-\srobf(\sstraj))^2}$
, and variance bars around it. 
As seen, the approximation error is small for all cases.
Note that while the RMSE  increased with the system dimension ($4^{th}$ formula in Fig.~\ref{fig:sample result}), it was observed that the relative error remained very small i.e. the increase in error is explained by an increase in the robustness's magnitude. 

%As suggested by Remark \ref{rem:upper bound}, the approximation error generally increases with the horizon (for a constant number of wavelet coefficients).
%This is due to the smooth max and min functions, as seen in \eqref{eq:smooth max error}.
%Fig. \ref{fig:relative error} shows the relative approximation errors, $(\robf-\srobf)/|\robf|$, for the formulae under consideration. 
%It is seen that the average relative approximation error is less than $10\%$ for all cases. 
%For some data points in Fig. \ref{fig:relative error}, the variance of relative error is high, but the error remains small in absolute terms as seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:sample result}.

%In general, the high relative approximation errors are due to trajectories which have a true robustness of near zero; 
%these lead to a spike in the relative approximation error, $(\robf-\srobf)/|\robf|$, even for small values of the absolute error $|\robf-\srobf|$.

\subsection{Robustness maximization for control}
\label{sec:toy example}
To solve Problem $P_\rob$ given in \eqref{eq:general_ctrl}, we replace the true robustness $\robf$ by its smooth approximation $\srobf$.
We thus obtain Problem $P_{\srob}$.
We illustrate the approach on a simple linear system,
and provide more extensive case studies in Section \ref{sec:case study}.
