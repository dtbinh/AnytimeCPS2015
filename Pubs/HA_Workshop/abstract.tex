	This work introduces smooth (inifintely) differentiable approximations to the robustness function of Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas~\cite{Fainekos2006_TLVerifSimu}. These approximations can be made arbirarily close to the true robustness, and enable the use of powerful gradient descent optimizers. We demonstrate that this approach outperforms state-of-the-art, MILP based, robustness maximizers for linear systems~\cite{Raman14_MPCSTL}.
