Many modern systems, like swarms of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), have complex spatio-temporal requirements that go beyond stability and tracking. In general, provably safe control of a large scale system like Air Traffic Control (ATC) or a UAV swarm is a hard problem to solve in real-time. While the complex underlying specifications of such systems can be formally mathematically captured in the framework Metric Temporal Logic (MTL), the problem of scalable control of dynamical systems given such specifications is not yet solved. State of the art approaches for control of systems with MTL specifications rely on solving Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) problems as the underlying optimization for control, and we show that they lack the scalability to solve large problems like ATC.
We introduce smooth (infinitely differentiable) approximations to the robustness function of MTL formula, which can be made arbitrarily close to the true robustness. This allows us to use powerful optimization methods to maximize this function for control of systems. In addition, we show how the structure of the robustness function itself, along with that of the specifications for multi-agent systems can be leveraged to massively parallelize the robustness computation. This allows us to evaluate and optimize over the function in real-time. We show how our proposed technique works on the ATC problem for the Chicago O'Hare airport terminal region. Simulations show our method can operate at scales impossible for existing tools, as well as the overall performance of the system compared to historical data of manual ATC operation.
