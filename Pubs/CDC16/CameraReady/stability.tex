\begin{theorem}[Stability]
	\label{thm:stability}
Given an equilibrium point $x_e \in X_0 \subset \iT(Z)$ of the nonlinear dynamics \eqref{eq:generic NLMPC}, Algorithm \ref{alg:RMPC} stabilizes the nonlinear system to an invariant set around $x_e$.
\end{theorem}
The proof is in the online report \cite{PantAM16_RMPC}.
