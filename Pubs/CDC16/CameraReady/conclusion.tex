\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}
In this paper we develop the first algorithm for robust control of a non-linear system with estimation errors and state and input constraints via feedback linearization and Robust MPC. 
We develop a method to compute linear constraints on the state and inputs of the feedback linearized system such that the non-linear system respects its state and input constraints under bounded state estimation errors. 
We demonstrate the applicability of our approach on a planar system and a flexible link manipulator example. Results show that the control algorithm stabilizes the systems while ensuring robust constraint satisfaction.% and being feasible at all time instants. 
While we only evaluated our approach for single input systems, the formulation and set computations involved hold as is for multi-input systems as well.

Limitations of the approach mostly have to do with the numerical limitations involved in computing the constraint sets.
E.g., in the manipulator example, the set of states $X_0$ from which we can control the system is a strict subset of the set of safe states $X$.
Similarly in the computation of the input and error sets, over-conservatism is potentially a problem.

%Ongoing work focuses on implementing this approach for evaluation on a $1/10^{th}$ scale autonomous car, running a low power embedded platform. 
%Real-time online reachability \cite{rtreach}, interval arithmetic,
%and support function based computations for $\bar{Z}_{k+j|k}$ should allow for fast enough computation of the linear constraints for the RMPC optimization. In \cite{PantAMNDM15_Anytime}, we have already shown that CVXGEN $\cite{cvxgen}$ is fast enough to solve Quadratic programs with linear constraints on low-powered embedded platforms at high enough sampling rates to allow for satisfactory control of a real system.
