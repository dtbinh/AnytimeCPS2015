	year={2013}, 
	pages={2056-2061}, 
	abstract={Model predictive control (MPC) is one of the most popular advanced control techniques and is used widely in industry. The main drawback with MPC is that it is fairly computationally expensive and this has so far limited its practical use for nonlinear systems. To reduce the computational burden of nonlinear MPC, Feedback Linearization together with linear MPC has been used successfully to control nonlinear systems. The main drawback is that this results in an optimization problem with nonlinear constraints on the control signal. In this paper we propose a method to handle the nonlinear constraints that arises using a set of dynamically generated local inner polytopic approximations. The main benefits of the proposed method is guaranteed recursive feasibility and convergence.},

	title={Formal Analysis of Timing Effects on Closed-Loop Properties of Control Software}, 
	year={2014}, 
	month={Dec}, 
	pages={53-62}, 
	abstract={The theories underlying control engineering and real-time systems engineering use idealized models that mutually abstract from central aspects of the other discipline. Control theory usually assumes jitter-free sampling and negligible (constant) input-output latencies, disregarding complex real-world timing effects. Real-time systems theory uses abstract performance models that neglect the functional behavior and derives worst-case situations with limited expressiveness for control functions, e.g., In physically dominated automotive systems. In this paper, we propose an approach that integrates state-of-the art timing models into functional analysis. We combine physical, control and timing models by representing them as a network of hybrid automata. Closed-loop properties can then be verified on this hybrid automata network by using standard model checkers for hybrid systems. Since the computational complexity is critical for model checking, we discuss abstract models of timing behavior that seem particularly suited for this type of analysis. The approach facilitates systematic co-engineering between both control and real-time disciplines, increasing design efficiency and confidence in the system. The approach is illustrated by analyzing an industrial example, the control software of an electro-mechanical braking system, with the hybrid model checker Space Ex.},
