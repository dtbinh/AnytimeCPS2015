\begin{theorem}[Stability]
	\label{thm:stability}
Given an equilibrium point $x_e \in X_0 \subset \iT(Z)$ of the nonlinear dynamics \eqref{eq:generic NLMPC}, the MPC controller stabilizes the nonlinear system to $x_e$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $T$ be the diffeomorphism mapping $x$ to $z$ from feedback linearization.
By a change of variables $z' = z - T(x_e)$, stabilizing the linear dynamics (with state $z'$) to 0 implies stabilizing the nonlinear dynamics to $x_e$.
Recall that $Q$ and $Q_f$ of  \eqref{eq:nom mpc} are positive definite and that $R$ is positive semi-definite,  so that the optimal cost $J^*(\nz_{k})$ is a positive definite function of $nz_{k}$, and that the terminal weight in \eqref{eq:nom mpc} is equivalent to the infinite horizon cost (by our choice of $Q_f$). 
Finally Thm.  \ref{th:robust_feas} guarantees that the tail of the input sequence computed at $k$ is admissible at time $k+1$. 
Therefore it is a standard result that the optimal cost $J^{*}(\nz_{k})$ is non-increasing in $k$ and that $0$ is a stable equilibrium for the closed-loop linear system. 
Moreover the system converges to 0 from anywhere in $Z$ (E.g., see \cite{CannonK15MPC} )
Therefore $x_k$ converges to $x_e$ from anywhere in $X_0 \subset \iT(Z)$ provided it starts in $X_0$.
