Robust predictive control of Non-linear systems under state estimation errors and input/state constraints has been challenging problem, and solutions to it have generally involved solving computationally hard non-linear, and times multiple, optimization problems. Feedback linearization has reduced the computation burden for predictive control of non-linear systems, but has of yet not been solved for robust model predictive control under estimation errors and constraints.
In this paper, we aim to solve this problem of robust control of a non-linear system under bounded state estimation errors and input/state constraints using feedback linearization. We do so by developing robust constraints on the feedback linearized system such that the non-linear system respects its constraints. These constraints are computed at run-time using online reachability in order to reduce the conservativeness of the constraints, and are linear in the optimization variables of the robust MPC problem that we solve, resulting in a computationally low cost Quadratic program with linear constraints. We also provide robust feasibility, recursive feasibility and stability results for our control algorithm, which are at par (if not stronger than) with those of the state of the art non-linear robust MPC solutions to this problem. We evaluate our approach on two systems to show its applicability and performance.
