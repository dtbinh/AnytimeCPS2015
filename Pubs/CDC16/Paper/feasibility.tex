\subsection{Robust Feasibility and Stability}
We are now ready to state the main result of this paper: namely, that the RMPC of the feedback linearized system \eqref{eq:nom mpc} is feasible at all time steps if it starts out feasible, and that it stabilizes the nonlinear system, for all possible values of the state estimation error and feedback linearization error.

\begin{theorem}[Robust Feasibility]
\label{th:robust_feas}
If at some time step $k_0 \geq 0$, the RMPC optimization $\Pk{k_0}$ is feasible, then all subsequent optimizations  $\Pk{k} k> k_0$ are also feasible.
Moreover, the nonlinear system \eqref{eq:generic NLMPC} controlled by algorithm \ref{alg:RMPC} and subject to the disturbances ($E$, $W$) satisfies its state and input constraints at all times $k \geq k_0$.
\end{theorem}
