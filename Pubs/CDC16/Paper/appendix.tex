\section*{Appendix}

Before we prove Theorem \ref{th:robust_feas}, we need a key intermediate result, which is summarized in Lemma \ref{lem:one}. This result directly follows from a) The construction of the reach sets $\bar{X}_{k+j|k}$ over which the sets for bounding $\tilde{e}_{k+j}$, $\tilde{E}_{k+j|k}$, the inner convex (hyper-rectangular) bounds for the control input $v_{k+j}$, $\underline{V}_{k+j|k}$, the outer convex (hyper-rectangular) bounds for the  $v_{k+j}$, $\bar{V}_{k+j|k}$ and the definition of the disturbance set $W_{k+j|k}$. The key point here is that $\bar{X}_{k+j+1|k} \supseteq \bar{X}_{k+j+1|k+1}, \, \forall j=0,1,\dotsc$ (see Section \textbf{sec:ErrorAndReachSets}), from which the other conditions stated in the Lemma follow by the definition of the corresponding set.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:one}
With the reachable set computation as defined as Section \textbf{sec:ErrorAndReachSets}), and the corresponding defintions of the sets $\tilde{E}_{k+j|k}$, $\underline{V}_{k+j|k}$, $\bar{V}_{k+j|k}$ and $W_{k+j|k}$, we have that $\forall j=0,1,\dotsc$
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\bar{X}_{k+j+1|k+1} \subseteq \bar{X}_{k+j+1|k}$, and hence by definition,
\item $\tilde{E}_{k+j+1|k+1} \subseteq \tilde{E}_{k+j+1|k}$
\item ${W}_{k+j+1|k+1} \subseteq {W}_{k+j+1|k}$
\item $\underline{V}_{k+j+1|k+1} \supseteq \underline{V}_{k+j+1|k}$
\item $\bar{V}_{k+j+1|k+1} \subseteq \bar{V}_{k+j+1|k}$
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma} 

\textbf{Proof of Theorem \ref{th:robust_feas}:} We will prove the Theorem by recursion by showing that if at time step $k$, the problem $\mathbb{P}_{k}(\hat{z}_k)$ is feasible and the feasible control input $v_k = v^{*}_{k|k}$ is applied, then $v_k$ is admissible (meets the system constraints) and at time $k+1$, $z_{k+1}$ is inside $Z$ and also $\mathbb{P}_{k+1}(\hat{z}_{k+1})$ is feasible for all disturbances. By recursion then, if we have feasibility at step $k=k_0$, we have robust constraint satisfaction and feasibility at time step $k_0+1$ and so on for all $k>k_0$. Note, to keep notational clutter to a minimum in the proof, we will drop the argument for the safe sets of Eq. \ref{eq:Set_constraints}, referring to them as $Z_{k+j|k+i}$ with the arguments defined accordingly.

To begin, let $\mathbb{P}_{k}(\hat{z}_k)$ be feasible, then it has a feasible solution $(\lbrace z^{*}_{k+j|k}\rbrace_{j=0}^{N+1}, \, \lbrace v^{*}_{k+j|k}\rbrace_{j=0}^{N} )$ that satisfies all the constraints of the Robust MPC. Now let's construct a feasible candidate solution for $\mathbb{P}_{k+1}(\hat{z}_{k+1})$ at the next time step by shifting the above solution one-step forward. Consider the candidate solution:

\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
\label{eq:candidate}
\bar{z}_{k+j+1|k+1} &= \bar{z}^{*}_{k+j+1|k} + L_j\hat{w}_{k+1}, \, \forall j =0,\dotsc,N \\
\bar{z}_{k+N+2|k+1}&= A\bar{z}_{k+N+1|k+1} + B\bar{v}_{k+N+1|k+1} \\
\bar{v}_{k+j+1|k+1}&=v^{*}_{k+j+1|k} + KL_j\hat{w}_{k+1}, \, \forall j =0,\dotsc,N-1 \\
\bar{v}_{k+N+1|k+1}&=K\bar{z}_{k+N+1|k+1} 
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

First we will show that the input and state constraints are satisfied $v_k$ and $z_{k+1}$, then prove feasibility of the above candidate solution for $\mathbb{P}_{k+1}(\hat{z}_{k+1})$.

\textit{Validity of the applied input and next state:}
The next state is:
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
\label{eq:z_next}
z_{k+1} &= Az_k + Bv_k + w_k = A(\hat{z}_k-\tilde{e}_k)+Bv^{*}_{k|k}+w_k \\
 &= A\hat{z}_k+Bv^{*}_{k|k}-\tilde{e}_{k+1}+(w_k+\tilde{e}_{k+1}-A\tilde{e}_k) \\
\text{Since }& z^{*}_{k|k}=\hat{z}_k \text{ by initial condition of } \mathbb{P}_{k}(\hat{z}_k) \nonumber \\
z_{k+1}&= z^{*}_{k+1|k} - \tilde{e}_{k+1} + \hat{w}_{k+1}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

By definition of $Z_{k+1|k}$ in Eq. \ref{eq:Set_constraints} and by feasibility of the solution at time $k$,
\begin{equation}
z^{*}_{k+1|k} \in Z_{k+1|k} = Z \ominus (-\tilde{E}_{k+1|k}) \ominus L_0W_{k+1|k}
\end{equation}

By definition, $\tilde{e}_{k+1} \in \tilde{E}_{k+1|k}$ and $\hat{w}_{k+1} \in  W_{k+1|k}$. Using this fact, definition of Pontraygin difference and Eq. \ref{eq:z_next} (also remember, $L_0 = \mathbb{I}$, we have:
\begin{equation}
z_{k+1}\in Z \Rightarrow x_{k+1} \in X \text{ by definition of Z}
\end{equation}

By the feasibility of $v^{*}_{k|k}$ for $\mathbb{P}_{k}(\hat{z}_k)$ and by the definition of $\underline{V}_{k|k}$,
\begin{equation}
v_k = v^{*}_{k|k} \in \underline{V}_{k|k} \Rightarrow u_k \in U
\end{equation}

Hence, if $\mathbb{P}_{k}(\hat{z}_k)$ is feasible, then the applied input at time step $k$ and the resulting next state $z_{k+1}$ (and hence $x_{k+1}$) are feasible under all possible disturbances. 
The next part of the proof will focus on showing that the candidate solution of Eq. \ref{eq:candidate} is indeed feasible for $\mathbb{P}_{k+1}(\hat{z}_{k+1})$ by proving that it meets all the constraints:

\textit{Initial Condition:} Note,
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
\hat{z}_{k+1} &= z_{k+1} + \tilde{e}_{k+1} = Az_{k+1} + Bv_k +w_k +\tilde{e}_{k+1} \\
&= A(z_k-\tilde{e}_k) + Bv_k + w_k +\tilde{e}_{k+1} \\
&= A\hat{z}_k + Bv_k + (w_k + \tilde{e}_{k+1} -A\tilde{e}_k)  \\
\hat{z}_{k+1}&=A\hat{z}_k + Bv_k + \hat{w}_{k+1}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
Also by the construction of the candidate solution,
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
\bar{z}_{k+1|k+1} &= z^{*}_{k+1|k} + L_0 \hat{w}_{k+1} \\
\bar{z}_{k+1} &= Az^{*}_{k|k} + Bv^{*}_{k|k} + \hat{w}_{k+1}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

Since, $z^{*}_{k|k}=\hat{z}_k$ and $v^{*}_{k|k} = v_k$, by the two equations above, we have
\begin{equation}
\bar{z}_{k+1|k+1} = \hat{z}_{k+1}
\end{equation}

Hence, the candidate solution does indeed satisfy the initial condition for $\mathbb{P}_{k+1}(\hat{z}_{k+1})$. Next we show that the candidate solution satisfies the nominal dynamics:

\textit{ Nominal Dynamics:} For $0\leq J<N$,we have:
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
&\bar{z}_{k+j+2|k+1} = z^{*}_{k+j+2|k} + L_{j+1}\hat{w}_{k+1} \\
&= Az^{*}_{k+j+1}+Bv^{*}_{k+j+1|k} + L_{j+1}\hat{w}_{k+1} \\
& \text{By the construction of the candidate solution} \nonumber \\
& = A(\bar{z}_{k+j+1|k+1}-L_j\hat{w}_{k+1}) + B(\bar{v}_{k+j+1|k+1} - KL_j \hat{w}_{k+1}) \nonumber \\
&\, + L_{j+1}\hat{w}_{k+1} \\
& = A\bar{z}_{k+j+1|k+1} + B\bar{v}_{k+j+1|k+1} -(A+BK)L_j\hat{w}_{k+1} \nonumber \\
&\,+ L_{j+1}\hat{w}_{k+1} \\
&\text{Using the definition of $L_{j+1}$ in Eq. \ref{eq:L_def},} \nonumber \\
& = A\bar{z}_{k+j+1|k+1} + B\bar{v}_{k+j+1|k+1} - L_{j+1}\hat{w}_{k+1} + L_{j+1}\hat{w}_{k+1} \\
& = A\bar{z}_{k+j+1|k+1} + B\bar{v}_{k+j+1|k+1}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

For $j=N$, by construction $\bar{z}_{k+N+2|k+1} = A\bar{z}_{k+N+1|k+1} + B\bar{v}_{k+N+1|k+1}$. Hence, the candidate solution does indeed satisfy the nominal dynamics.

\textit{State Constraints:} To show feasibility of the candidate solution w.r.t the state constraints, we need to show that $\bar{z}_{(k+1)+j|k+1}\in Z_{j|k+1}\, \forall j=0,\dotsc,N$. Re-writing Eq.\ref{eq:Set_constraints} for $\mathbb{P}_{k}(\hat{z}_k)$ for $j=0,\dotsc,N-1$, we have:

\begin{subequations}
\label{eq:redef_Zj}
\begin{align}
Z_{j+1|k} &= Z \ominus_{i=0}^{j}L_iW_{k+j+1-i|k} \ominus (-\tilde{E}_{k+j+1|k}) \\
Z_{j+1|k} &= Z \ominus L_jW_{k+1|l} \ominus_{i=1}^{j}L_iW_{k+j+1-i|k} \ominus (-\tilde{E}_{k+j+1|k})\\
Z_{j+1|k} &= Z \ominus L_jW_{k+1|l} \ominus_{i=0}^{j-1}L_iW_{k+j-i|k} \ominus (-\tilde{E}_{k+j+1|k})
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

Also, let us write the state constraints for all $j=0,\dotsc,N$ for the problem at time $k+1$, i.e. for $\mathbb{P}_{k+1}(\hat{z}_{k+1})$:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:redef_Zjp1}
Z_{j|k+1} = Z \ominus_{i=0}^{j-1}L_iW_{k+j-i|k+1} \ominus (-\tilde{E}_{k+1+j|k+1}) \\
\end{equation}

Remember, by construction of the candidate, we have $\bar{z}_{k+j+1|k+1} = z^{*}_{k+j+1|k} + L_j\hat{w}_{k+1}$.
Also by feasibility of the algorithm at time $k$, we have $z^{*}_{k+j+1|k}\in Z_{j+1|k}$, and by definition, $L_j\hat{w}_{k+1} \in L_j{W}_{k+1|k}$. Therefore, by the definition of Pontraygin difference, and Eq. \ref{eq:redef_Zj}, we have $\forall j=0,\dotsc,N-1$,
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
&\bar{z}_{(k+1)+j|k+1} \in Z \ominus_{i=0}^{j-1}L_iW_{k+j-i|k} \ominus (-\tilde{E}_{k+j+1|k}) \\
&\text{Using points 2) and 3) from Lemma \ref{lem:one} } \nonumber \\ 
&Z \ominus_{i=0}^{j-1}L_iW_{k+j-i|k} \ominus (-\tilde{E}_{k+j+1|k}) \subseteq Z \ominus_{i=0}^{j-1}L_iW_{k+j-i|k+1}  \nonumber \\
& \ominus (-\tilde{E}_{k+j+1|k+1}) \\
&\text{ And using Eq. \ref{eq:redef_Zjp1}, this imples } \nonumber \\
&\bar{z}_{(k+1)+j|k+1} \in Z_{j|k+1}
\end{align} 
\end{subequations}

Therefore, we have $\bar{z}_{k+1+j|k+1} \in Z_{j|k+1},\,\forall j=0,\dotsc,N-1$. 

Now for $j=N$, $\bar{z}_{k+N+1|k} = z^{*}_{k+N+1|k+1} + L_N\hat{w}_{k+1}$. From the terminal constraint we have $[z^{*}_{k+N+1|k}\, v^{*}_{k+N|k}] \in Z_f = C \ominus \hat{L}_N\hat{F}W_{max}$. Since $w_{k+1} \in W_{max}$, and by the construction of the candidate solution (and using the definition of Pontraygin difference, we have), 

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:CandidateInC}
[\bar{z}_{k+N+1|k+1}\, \bar{v}_{k+N|k+1}]' \in C
\end{equation}

Remember, by definition of the invariant set, $C \in Z_N(\tilde{E}_{max},\tilde{E}_{max})$, and since by definition of $\tilde{E}_{max}$ and Eq. \ref{eq:Set_constraints}, we have $Z_N(\tilde{E}_{max},\tilde{E}_{max}) \subseteq Z_{N|k+1} \times V_{N|k+1}$, or $C \in  Z_{N|k+1} \times {V}_{N|k+1}$. This implies that $\bar{z}_{k+N+1|k+1} \in Z_{N|k+1}$ and additionally, $v_{k+N|k+1} \in {V}_{N|k+1}$.
Therefore, the set constraints are met by candidate solution $\forall j=0,\dotsc,N$. 

\textit{Input Constraints:} For the inputs, it is straight forward to show that the candidate solution, $\bar{v}_{k+j+1|k+1}$ satisfies the input constraints for $\mathbb{P}_{k+1}(\hat{z}_{k+1}) $, $\forall j=0,\dotsc,N-2$ by using a similar process we used for the state constraints. For $j=N-1$, we have already shown above that by definition of the invariant set $C$, $v_{k+N|k+1} \in {V}_{N|k+1}$. For the last input for $j=N$, we show next that it lies in the terminal set $Z_f$, which implies it is feasible for $\mathbb{P}_{k+1}(\hat{z}_{k+1})$.

\textit{Terminal Constraints:} Finally, we need to show that $[\bar{z}_{k+N+2} \bar{v}_{k+N+1}]' \in Z_f$. This can be shown using the construction of the terminal set and the candidate solution. From Equation \ref{eq:candidate}, we have:
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
\bar{z}_{k+N+2|k+1}&=A\bar{z}_{k+N+1|k+1} + B\bar{v}_{k+N+1|k} \\
\bar{v}_{k+N+1|k+1}&=K\bar{z}_{k+N+1|k+1}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

Concatenate these two into $p_{k+N+2|k+1} = [\bar{z}_{k+N+2}\, \bar{v}_{k+N+1}]'$. Also $p_{k+N+1|k+1} = [\bar{z}_{k+N+1} \,\bar{v}_{k+N}]'$ was in $Z_f$ as shown previously. Therefore, by definition of the invariant set $C$ (Equation \ref{eq:C_def}), we have that $p_{k+N+2|k+1} + \hat{L}_N \hat{F} w_{k+1|k}$ is in $C$ since $w_{k+1|k}\in W_{max}$. Therefore by definition of Pontraygin difference, $p_{k+N+2|k+1} \in C \ominus \hat{L}_N\hat{F}W_{max} = Z_f$. Therefore the terminal constraint is also met.

With this, we have the proof for Theorem 1 as we have shown that feasible solution at time step $k$ for $\mathbb{P}_{k}(\hat{z}_{k}) $ implies that the applied input $v_k$ is feasible, the next state $z_{k+1} \in Z$ and the problem $\mathbb{P}_{k+1}(\hat{z}_{k+1}) $ is feasible at time $k+1$, and hence  $\mathbb{P}_{k+2}(\hat{z}_{k+2}) $ is feasible for time step $k+2$ and so on.
