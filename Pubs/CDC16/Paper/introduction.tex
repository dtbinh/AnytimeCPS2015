This:
nonlinear control with mpc on feedback linearized dynamics with state estimation error, input constraints, state constraints

Previous work: feedback linearization but no state constraints and identity T, no state uncertainty

New:	
state constraints, 
non-identity T,
state uncertainty,
recursive feasibility with time-varying error sets

Given a subset $\Xc$ of a dynamical system's state space, and a horizon $T \geq 0$, the \emph{reachable set of the system from $\Xc$ in time $T$} is the set of states that the system visits, at time $T$ if it starts somewhere in $\Xc$.
Formally, $\RT{\Xc} \defeq \{y \in X \such \exists x_0 \in \Xc: x \text{ is a trajectory of the system, }x(0)=x_0, x(T)=y\}$.

\textbf{Notation}.
Given two subsets $A,B$ of $\Re^n$, define their \textit{Minkowski sum} to be $A\oplus B \defeq \{a+b \such a\in A, b\in B\}$.
Define their Pontryagin difference to be $A\ominus B = \{c \in \Re^n \such c+b \in A\; \forall b \in B\}$
