	This work introduces smooth (infinitely differentiable) approximations to the robustness function of Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas. These approximations can be made arbitrarily close to the true robustness, and enable the use of powerful gradient descent optimizers for offline testing and online planning. We demonstrate that this approach outperforms state-of-the-art, MILP based, robustness maximizers for linear systems~\cite{Raman14_MPCSTL}.
